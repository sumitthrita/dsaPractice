DSA Week 1: Arrays and Strings - Daily Practice Plan

Overview
This week focuses on Arrays and Strings - the most fundamental data structures in programming. Master these concepts as they form the foundation for more complex topics.

Learning Objectives
-Understand array manipulation techniques
-Master string processing algorithms
-Learn time and space complexity analysis
-Practice problem-solving patterns


Week 1 Success Metrics

 We are going to solve all 21 problems
 Understand time/space complexity for each solution
 Implement at least 2 different approaches for medium/hard problems
 Can explain the logic behind each solution
 Identify common patterns (two pointers, sliding window, hash maps)

Key Patterns Learned This Week
--Two Pointers: Efficient for palindromes, sorted arrays, finding pairs
--Sliding Window: Optimal for substring/subarray problems
--Hash Maps: Fast lookups for duplicates, anagrams, complements
--In-place Modification: Space-efficient array manipulation
--Prefix/Suffix Processing: Useful for product arrays, cumulative sums
